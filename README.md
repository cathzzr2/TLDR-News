## üìã Requirements

- Most Updated Chrome Browser
- Hugging Face API Key (free tier available)
- Internet connection for AI model inference

## üîí Privacy

- All data stays on your device
- Only article text sent to Hugging Face for summarization
- No personal information collected

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

### Summarization Limitations
Due to free tier model constraints, the current summarization has limitations:
- **Token Length Limits**: Free Hugging Face models have query token limits (usually ~10 sentences)
- **Chunking Required**: Long articles must be split into chunks for processing
- **Coherence Loss**: Combining chunk summaries can reduce article coherence
- **Improvement Needed**: Better chunking algorithms and summary combination methods are needed
- **Multilingual Support**: Current free model only supports English, Chinese, Spanish, and French translation with restricted accuracy.
